    "<p>In this project we will primarily reference datasets concerning the NBA. By the end of this project, we wil be able to predict the win/loss ratio of every team in the NBA along with a grade that we will give to their team based on player stats that they have averaged for every season that they have been in the NBA.<br>Using Basketball Reference, and more specifically https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/ for every player that we will consider (active players only), and https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/ for the previous records that teams achieved. <br>For training, we will consider the stats that players have previously achieved (ie. their averages for points, assists, rebounds, steals, blocks, fouls etc.) and compile that into team stats. (We cannot use base team stats for testing as future NBA teams will not be composed of the same players that they currently have.) Using this trainging set we can also train the win loss categor for teams based on these stats and then use similar testing sets to make predictions about the future, such as the 2025-2026 season and 2026-2027 season.</p>"

    "<p>As this project will be much larger and wider in scope from previous programming assignments that we have completed in this class, we expect there to be a lot of difficulties in pre-processing<br><br>A large one that we are currently considering is the fact that some players may have spenta lot of time hurt in their carrer and may be missing some stats in some categories or will even be considered in active going into seasons or may be on Free Agency and will not yet be associated with a team or may even be traded to other teams which could affect the outcome of our predictions throughout different seasons. To combat this, in training, we will make it a goal to only consider teams' stats after seasons have ended. <br><br>Another aspect we are considering is the overall development of players. Although not a direct issue with technical implementation, younger players are often inconsistent in their earkly years and may see a lot of growth or decline depending on the time that they are allowed to play. <br><br>This may cause issues with our training end testing when we attempt to build a classifier that is accurate, so we have a number of options to consider when dealing with cases like this. Voiding younger players stats, or not counting them as much when testing could be possible options. We may also have to consider rookies that will be playing for teams in the future because they do not have any stats in the NBA. In this case, we may want to create a small classifier to predict a few stats based on college performance which is data we can alos obtain on Basketball Reference. </p>"

    "<p>The potential people that may use this type of project is very large as the NBA is a huge organization that many people have a deep interst in<br><br>The more obvious people / stakeholders that may want to consider our results are team owners and GMs. With these results they may be able to have a better insight on what they outcome for their team is looking like and what aspects are returning this result. For example, if our classifier predicts that their team will not obtain enough wins to make the playoffs, they may want to make a push for players that will help their team in the categories that are causing this prediction to be worse than they want. <br><br>Due to the recent and large growth in online sports gambling, many people have become obsessed with stats so that they can hit big and make money. Poeple may use our classifier to try and make more educated sport bets or may even allow people that control these online sports betting websites like Draft Kings to create better and more well predicted odds to keep people from winning money.<br><br>Other people that would likely be interesed in this are casual and die hard NBA fans. People on the internet ove to talk about sports and investigate stats that their team is putting up, with their ability to see something similar to what we will create; we believe that they would be very interested in checking our results and doing their own investigations.<br><br>A less likely scenario, but also possible, is the implementation of our project into popular video games like NBA 2k. In many of these games, therre are modes where people can assume the position of a team manager and are allowed to make moves to imporove their team in hopes of winning a championship. If they were able to see a projection or prediction of what their team will achieve in future years with their current players, it may allow them to make more informed decisions about what the next steps to take are</p>"
